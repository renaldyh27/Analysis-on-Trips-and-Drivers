# Analysis on Trips and Drivers Performance

This project analyzes trips location data and drivers' behavioral and performance data in order to answer the following questions:

Main Question: What Key Performance Indicators(KPI) of a driver should an enterprise pay attention to in order to achieve better safety and reduce costs?	

• What are the variables we should look out for in the data?

• How can we create a better benchmarking system (comparing a driver to a standard)?     

• How do we define this standard? 

• Which drivers are exceeding the standards and expectations? 

• Which drivers are below the minimum standards?

# Project-Description
This is student project in collaboration with Tourmaline Labs, an AI mobility company that enables large enterprises to drive better business outcomes and more efficiently manage their transportation workforce. They collect data ranging from location data, trip data, driving behavior data, and other related data and we have been given a sample of their dataset to work on this project and assist them in bringing better business insights.

### Methods
- Statistical Methods (ANOVA, Mutiple paired-comparison tests)
- Data Analysis 
- Data Visualization

### Tools
- Power BI: We used PowerBI to create all of the visualizations for the dashboards.
- Snowflake and SQL: Data was stored on a Snowflake cloud database and we used SQL to query, transform and load the data into PowerBI for visualization.
- Python: Most of the initial EDA and statistical tests was done with Python.
