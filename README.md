# Analysis on Trips and Drivers Performance

This project analyzes trips location data and drivers' behavioral and performance data in order to answer the following questions:

Main Question: What Key Performance Indicators(KPI) of a driver should an enterprise pay attention to in order to achieve better safety and reduce costs?	

• What are the variables we should look out for in the data?

• How can we create a better benchmarking system (comparing a driver to a standard)?     

• How do we define this standard? 

• Which drivers are exceeding the standards and expectations? 

• Which drivers are below the minimum standards?
